## 🌒 Design Philosophy / デザインコンセプト

**English:**
This theme is optimized for users who prefer low screen brightness or find overly colorful themes distracting. By focusing on high-contrast structural boundaries rather than excessive syntax highlighting, it ensures clear visibility regardless of your monitor's brightness settings. It is specifically crafted to support dark adaptation, providing a "Vivid, Simple, and Dark" experience that reduces eye strain during long sessions.

**Japanese:**
画面のブライトネス設定が低い方や、カラフルすぎるテーマが苦手な方に最適です。過度な色の装飾を抑え、境界線を強調することで、画面の明るさに左右されない視認性を追求しました。暗順応を妨げない配色を徹底的に検証した結果、この「鮮明でシンプルでダークなテーマ」が完成しました。

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Seamless Migration from Dark Modern**: Built upon the foundation of VS Code's standard 'Dark Modern'. You can switch to this theme without any learning curve or visual discomfort.
- **Improved Tab & UI Visibility**: Distinct boundaries around tabs and activity bars make it instantly clear which file is active, even in multi-window or browser-heavy workflows.
- **Vivid Logic Boundaries**:
  - **Vivid Red**: Clearly marks the Activity Bar edge.
  - **Cool Blue**: Defines the Sidebar and Active Indent guides.
- **Professional & Clean**: While adding vital visual cues, headers and text remain in classic professional white/gray to keep your focus on the code.
